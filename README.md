Inventory Management System
This is an Inventory Management System built in Python to manage product sales and update inventory. The system provides features such as listing products, updating inventory, handling sales, and calculating Goods and Services Tax (GST) on each sale.

Features
View Product Details: Displays a list of all products with their name, price, and available quantity.
User Input: Collects customer details and purchase information.
Inventory Update: Automatically updates the inventory after each purchase.
GST Calculation: Adds an 18% GST to the product price and calculates the final billing amount.
Sales Logging: Records each sale along with customer details and the date/time of the transaction.
Error Handling: If there is insufficient inventory, the system asks if the customer would like to purchase the available quantity.

Usage
Product Listing: The system first displays a list of products, including their name, price, and available quantity.

Customer Details: The user is prompted to enter their name, email, phone number, product ID, and quantity.

Billing: The system calculates the total amount, including GST, and prints a detailed bill.

Inventory Update: The inventory is updated automatically after each sale. If the user attempts to purchase more than the available stock, the system prompts them to buy the available quantity.
